WARNING:Place:838 - An IO Bus with more than one IO standard is found.
   Components associated with this bus are as follows: 
   	 Comp: data_u<0>   IOSTANDARD = SSTL2_I
   	 Comp: data_u<1>   IOSTANDARD = LVTTL
   	 Comp: data_u<2>   IOSTANDARD = LVTTL

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
